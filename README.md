# What is this tool?

This tool makes it easier to train skills, since it will send keystrokes to Tibia Client and prevent you from getting kicked out after 15 minutes.

# Can I get banned for it?

Probably. I made sure to make every action very human like, with random delays between actions to mimic a person. Of course it won't stop from people reporting you, and maybe Cipsoft getting a close look at your online time, so do not go 100% AFK with it.

# Do I need to give Administrator Privileges to run this tool?

Nope. Unless you are running the Tibia Client as Administrator, because non Administrator programs cannot interfere or engage with programs running as Administrator.
